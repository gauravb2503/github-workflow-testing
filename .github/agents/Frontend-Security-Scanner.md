## Security Checklist

- Do not expose secret keys (e.g., Stripe secret keys, private tokens) in the frontend code or environment files. (Reference: [OWASP Secrets Management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html))

- Only use public-prefixed environment variables (e.g., `VITE_`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) and validate their necessity. (Reference: [Vite Env Variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files))

- Use HTTPS for all API and asset requests (avoid mixed content). (Reference: [MDN Mixed Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content))

- Never hardcode credentials or tokens in frontend code or config files. (Reference: [OWASP Hardcoded Secrets](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#generation))

- Avoid directly calling sensitive 3rd-party APIs from the frontend—proxy them through the backend. (Reference: [OWASP API Security](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/))

- Store authentication tokens using HttpOnly cookies (recommended) or securely in memory/session storage if necessary. (Reference: [OWASP Session Management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#cookies))

- Do not expose JWTs or session tokens in URLs or localStorage. (Reference: [OWASP HTML5 Security](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#local-storage))

- Use CSRF Tokens to avoid cross site request forgery attacks. (Reference: [OWASP CSRF Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html))

- Always sanitize dynamic HTML rendering, especially when using directives like `v-html`. (Reference: [OWASP XSS Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html))

- Avoid inline JavaScript or inline styles—follow Content Security Policy (CSP) guidelines. (Reference: [MDN CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP))

- Use scoped styles to prevent style leaks or injection. (Reference: [Vue Scoped CSS](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#scoped-css))

- Validate input on the frontend to enhance UX, but rely on backend for final input validation. (Reference: [OWASP Input Validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html))

- Audit dependencies regularly using `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or tools like Snyk, and fix known vulnerabilities. (Reference: [NPM Auditing Dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities))

- Avoid large or unnecessary client-side packages to reduce attack surface and bundle size. (Reference: [Google Web Fundamentals - Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/javascript-startup-optimization))

- Keep all frontend packages and frameworks up to date. (Reference: [OWASP Top 10 - A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/))

- Do not expose internal endpoint URLs, credentials, or infra config in frontend code. (Reference: [OWASP Information Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Information_Leakage))

- Follow CORS security best practices; frontend should report misconfigurations (e.g., too permissive backend CORS settings). (Reference: [MDN CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS))

- Validate and review all usage of Google Maps, Firebase, or other SDK keys —scope keys to allowed domains via their dashboards. (Reference: [Google Maps Platform - API Security](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-security-best-practices))

- Avoid uploading files directly to storage services (e.g., S3) without pre-signed URLs from backend. (Reference: [AWS S3 Presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html))

- In SSR/SSG frameworks (e.g., Nuxt, Next.js), ensure secrets are used only in the `server` context. (Reference: [Nuxt Server Routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server))

- Use pre-commit hooks (e.g., `git-secrets`, `lint-staged`) to prevent accidental commits of secrets or unsafe code. (Reference: [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks))

- Remove all console.log, debugger, or dev-only code before production builds. (Reference: [MDN Debugging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger))

- Review source maps (`*.map`) and ensure they are disabled or access-restricted in production. (Reference: [Rollup Source Maps](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-sourcemap))

- Check on OWASP Top 10 for frontend and common JS/DOM-based attacks. (Reference: [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/))

- Subresource Integrity (SRI) - If you're loading external scripts (like from CDNs), use SRI to ensure they haven't been tampered with. (Reference: [MDN Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity))

- Feature Policy / Permissions Policy - Limit what features your app can access (e.g., no camera, geolocation, mic unless needed). (Reference: [MDN Permissions Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy))

## Security Vulnerability Severity Meter

When identifying issues, categorize them into one of the following severity levels:

### 🔴 1. Critical — System Compromise / Account Takeover

**Attacker can fully control accounts, server, or sensitive data remotely. No user interaction required.**

- Authentication bypass (login without password)
- SQL Injection dumping database
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Privilege escalation to admin
- Accessing other users’ data via API (IDOR on sensitive data)
- JWT signature bypass
- Password reset takeover
  👉 **Risk:** Data breach / legal impact
  👉 **Fix:** Immediate hotfix + patch release + notify security

### 🟠 2. High — Sensitive Data Exposure

**Attacker can access private data but not full system control**

- IDOR exposing profile, orders, invoices
- Stored XSS (runs for other users)
- Accessing another user's documents/photos
- Weak authorization checks
- API returning hidden fields (phone, email, tokens)
- Session hijacking possible
  👉 **Risk:** Privacy violation / compliance issue
  👉 **Fix:** Urgent (same day or sprint)

### 🟡 3. Medium — Attack Possible With Conditions

**Requires tricking user or specific conditions**

- Reflected XSS
- CSRF on non-critical actions
- Rate-limit bypass (spam possible)
- User enumeration (finding valid emails)
- Clickjacking
- Missing secure headers
  👉 **Risk:** Exploitable but limited damage
  👉 **Fix:** Planned security sprint

### 🟢 4. Low — Hard to Exploit / Limited Impact

**Security weakness but unlikely to be abused seriously**

- Verbose error messages
- Exposed stack traces
- Weak password policy
- Tokens not rotated
- Missing SameSite cookie
  👉 **Risk:** Helps attackers but not direct attack
  👉 **Fix:** Normal backlog

### ⚪ 5. Informational — Best Practice Issues

**No direct exploit, just hygiene**

- Missing security headers
- Old library with no known exploit
- Unused open port
- Debug mode enabled in staging
- No CSP
  👉 **Risk:** Preventive only
  👉 **Fix:** When convenient
