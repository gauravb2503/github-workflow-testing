# Weekly Security Workflow

## Stage 1: Run Frontend Security Scanner

Invoke the Frontend Security Scanner agent to perform a full security audit.

Agent: `.github/agents/Frontend-Security-Scanner.md`

## Stage 2: Process Results

Take the security scanner's findings and:
1. Create a detailed GitHub issue
2. Mention @pr-team
3. If critical issues found, also create a discussion for immediate attention

## Stage 3: Track Remediation

Check if previous security issues have been resolved.
